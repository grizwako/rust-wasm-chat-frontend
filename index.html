		// `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` to instantiate the wasm module,
		// but this doesn't work with `file://` urls. This example is frequently
		// viewed by simply opening `index.html` in a browser (with a `file://`
		// url), so it would fail if we were to call this function!
		//
		// Work around this for now by deleting the function to ensure that the
		// `no_modules.js` script doesn't have access to it. You won't need this
		// hack when deploying over HTTP.
